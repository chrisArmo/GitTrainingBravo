PISTACHIO:

  A place for the unresolved wanderers who seek solace and salvation from the dark beyond.

  Weary he be, the lonely traveler treading abandoned avenues of wretched way.

DUNCAN:

  A file for ghosts, readable by ghosts, all else must avert their eyes or be cursed.

  If you've read this far, there is no going back, for though is doomed from here to an eternity.

MYA:

  I'm am the ghost of retribution and serve to teach those who are damned the way of the quaking shadow.

  The quaking shadow is how we of purgatory place come to terms with our endless agony.

MARILYN:

  A sad life taken far too young. Depressed and suffering a plight of suicidal misdirection to cover horrendous truth.

  Tale of murder and deception; a story of bright light diminished to expire unfortunate happening.

  Such a beautiful spirit fire. What a warrior wouldn't do to bring her back for soul exchange.
